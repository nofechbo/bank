## Environment Variables

All environment variables are defined in `.env.example`. Copy it as `.env` and fill in your backend URL:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3030
```

This value is used in `src/config.ts` to construct API requests. Change it to your deployment address when deploying.

---

## Setup & Development

1. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Start the dev server**:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host=0.0.0.0
```

* Visit the app at: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
* `--host=0.0.0.0` allows testing on other devices on your local network

---

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in `/dist`. You can deploy them using any static server or integrate with the backend server to serve as static assets.

## ðŸ“± Mobile Responsiveness

The UI is fully responsive and optimized for mobile screens:
The UI is fully responsive and optimized for mobile screens:

- All core pages (Signup, Login, Dashboard, Transfer) scale and align properly on small devices.
- Navigation and layout adapt dynamically using Material UI breakpoints.
- Key UI adjustments for mobile:
  - Logo and illustration sizes scale down
  - Forms shrink to fit and align to the top
  - Dashboard shows tabs to toggle between *Transactions* and *Chart*
  - Tables and charts resize and become horizontally scrollable
  - Modals (errors, success) are capped in width and padded for smaller viewports
  - Buttons are always visible and stacked if needed

No separate mobile build is needed â€” the web app is touch-friendly and accessible on any phone browser.

## Notes

* Uses `localStorage` to persist login across refreshes
* Authentication state is managed by a React Context (`AuthContext`)
* All sensitive routes are protected using a `ProtectedRoutes` wrapper
* WebSocket connection is handled by a custom hook (useDashboardSocket) in the dashboard. It listens for dashboard:update messages and triggers a data refresh.
* `/dashboard`, `/transfer`, and `/verify` are fully functional
* `.env` is **not committed to git** â€” instead, `.env.example` is provided
